            <h3>Early Life and Education</h3>
            <p>
                Schrödinger was born on August 12, 1887, in Vienna, Austria, the only child of botanist and oil cloth
                factory owner Rudolf Schrödinger and Georgine Emilia Brenda, daughter of Alexander Bauer, Rudolf's
                professor of chemistry at the Technical College of Vienna (Technische Hochschule Vienna). Schrödinger
                was taught at home by private teachers until he was 11 years old, and then attended Vienna's
                Akademisches Gymnasium. He went on to enter the University of Vienna, where he focused primarily on the
                study of physics and was strongly influenced by another young physicist, Fritz Hasenöhrl, and graduated
                with a Ph.D. in physics in 1910. Afterward, he worked for a few years at the institution as an assistant
                but was drafted into World War I in 1914, serving with Austro-Hungarian military forces in Italy as an
                artillery officer.

            <p>
                Upon returning to civilian life, Schrödinger married Annemarie Bertel in 1920. He also
                took on a number of faculty/staff positions at places like the University of Stuttgart, the University
                of Jena and the University of Breslau, before joining the University of Zurich in 1921.

            <h3>The Schrödinger Wave Equation</h3>
            <p>
                Schrödinger's tenure as a professor at the University of Zurich over the next six years would prove to
                be one of the most important periods of his physics career. Immersing himself in an array of theoretical
                physics research, Schrödinger came upon the work of fellow physicist Louis de Broglie in 1925. In his
                1924 thesis, de Broglie had proposed a theory of wave mechanics. This sparked Schrödinger's interest in
                explaining that an electron in an atom would move as a wave. The following year, he wrote a
                revolutionary paper that highlighted what would be known as the Schrödinger wave equation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Following the
                atomic model of Niels Bohr and a thesis from de Broglie, Schrödinger articulated the movements of
                electrons in terms of wave mechanics as opposed to particle leaps. He provided a mode of thought to
                scientists that would become accepted and incorporated into thousands of papers, becoming an important
                cornerstone of quantum theory. Schrödinger made this discovery in his late 30s, with most theoretical
                physicists sharing groundbreaking finds in their 20s.

            <h3>Nobel Prize Winner</h3>
            <p>
                In 1927, Schrödinger left his position at Zurich for a new, prestigious opportunity at the University of
                Berlin, where he met Albert Einstein. He held this position until 1933, opting to leave upon the rise of
                Adolf Hitler's Nazi Party and the related persecution of Jewish citizens. Shortly after joining the
                faculty of Oxford University in England, Schrödinger learned that he had won the 1933 Nobel Prize in
                Physics, sharing the award with another quantum theorist, Paul A.M. Dirac. In his Nobel Prize acceptance
                speech, Schrödinger stated that his mentor, Hasenöhrl, would be accepting the award if he hadn't died
                during World War I.
            </p>
            <p>
                Following a three-year stay at Oxford, Schrödinger traveled and worked in different countries, including
                in Austria at the University of Graz. In 1939, he was invited by Irish Prime Minister Eamon de Valera to
                work at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Dublin, Ireland, heading its School for Theoretical
                Physics. He remained in Dublin until the mid-1950s, returning in 1956 to Vienna, where he continued his
                career at his alma mater.

            <h3>Books, Final Years and Death</h3>
            <p>
                In terms of his writing, Schrödinger published the influential book What Is Life?, his attempt to link
                quantum physics and genetics, in 1944. He was also versed in philosophy and metaphysics, as evidenced in
                Nature and the Greeks (1954), which looked at ancient belief systems and inquiries; and his final book,
                My View of the World (1961), inspired by the Vedanta and exploring belief in a unified consciousness.
            </p>
            <p>
                Schrödinger died on January 4, 1961, in his hometown of Vienna. A 1989 book on his life was written by
                professor Walter J. Moore—Schrödinger: Life and Thought.
